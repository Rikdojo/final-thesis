# final-thesis
This is my bachelor thesis project. 

In Japanese agriculture, green soybeans are graded according to Cooperative standards before dispatched to retailers such as supermarket and groceries. This sorting task is still done manually by hands, which leads to overwork for Japanese farmers. In this study, we focused on the automation of the grading tasks using AI.  This research involved with a mixture of computer vision and the use of a single-short classification deep neural network and proposed a method for collecting images of green soybeans from multiple angles including top and side angles. Using the custom dataset, we enhanced AI model performance, achieving a grading accuracy of 93%, which exceeds previous studies.
